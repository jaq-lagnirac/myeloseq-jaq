# Python scripts

## A breakdown of the scripts in this subdirectory.

`annotate_table_vcf.py` - Takes the table generated by `coverage_table.py` and a directory of `.vcf` files for the coverages used and annotates the `set=` (the origin of the coverages). Can handle `dragen`, `pindel`, and `dragen-pindel`, with any other source being counted as a miscellaneous `unknown` set.

`coverage_table.py` - An extension of `json_bed_comparison.py`, takes a directory of directories (generated by `generate_directories.py`) and generates a comparison table to compare the coverage of the requisite `.json` and `.bed` files.

`generate_directories.py` - Takes a directory of unsorted `.json` and `.bed` files and copies them into a new main directory, sorted into subdirectories by file name.

`json_bed_comparison.py` - Takes directory of directories (generated by `generate_directories.py`) and compares the coverage of the requisite `.json` and `.bed` files, outputting the results into a `.err` file.
