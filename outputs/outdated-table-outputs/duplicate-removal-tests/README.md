# Duplicate Removal

Small-scale testing outputs comparing original table generation with new and updated table generation which removes duplicates. Duplicate removal is now in the `py/` directory.

`test.tsv` contains duplicates, with `test.err` containing the statistics.

`test_no_duplicates.tsv` contains the new table without duplicates, with `test_no_duplicates.err` containing the statistics.
